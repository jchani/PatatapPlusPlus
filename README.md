# PatatapPlusPlus

An animation and sound kit played with your keyboard that allows you to record your creations. 

##Installation
1) Clone this repo.

2) Then, install the p5.js editor from https://p5js.org/download/ and open the Animations project within the editor. 


##Usage
Hit the play button and press any sequence of keys from A-Z. 

Each key from A through Z plays a unique sound. Animations are unique row-wise while colors are different column-wise. The spacebar changes the color of the background. The return key toggles between real-time and recording mode (which is not currently not fully functional). 

The musicalpaintings project is a fun variation of Animations. It is identical except for the omission of one line of code, resulting in each frame of every animation to persist in the window - creating a sort of "musical painting"!
